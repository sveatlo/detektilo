# Detektilo

This project was created as part of my bachelor thesis on [FIT BUT](https://www.fit.vutbr.cz/) for the [SuperLectures](https://superlectures.com/) portal.
The original title is "Robust Screen and Slide Detection in Video".

The goal of this project is to detect projection screen in a video and select the correct image from the presentation for synchronization of slides and video.
